# Clasificator

Clasificator is a practice project focused on training machine learning models for image classification using various types of neural networks, data processing, and transformation techniques. The project is divided into two main parts: ML and Client-Side.

## ML

The `ml` folder contains notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. It covers the entire machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, model development, and model evaluation. Please refer to the `README.md` file in the `ml` folder for detailed instructions on how to use and understand this part of the project.

## Client-Side

The `client-side` folder contains the client-side component developed using React. It provides a user interface where users can upload images and utilize the pre-trained classification models to obtain predictions. Please refer to the `README.md` file in the `client-side` folder for detailed instructions on how to use and understand this part of the project.

For more information and instructions on how to set up the environment, run the project, and utilize different functionalities, please refer to the respective `README.md` files in each folder.

Clasificator combines the power of machine learning with the flexibility and responsiveness of React to provide an efficient image classification application. If you have any questions or need assistance, please consult the documentation in each folder and feel free to contact our support team.
