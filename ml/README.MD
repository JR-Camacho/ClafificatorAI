# Machine Learning Documentation

This document provides an overview and guide for the machine learning (ML) part of the project. The ML code is organized into different folders, including data, notebooks, preprocessing, and models.

## Data

The `data` folder contains the datasets used for training and evaluation. These datasets are typically downloaded from TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS) or other relevant sources. The specific datasets used for each model can be found within the respective notebook files.

## Notebooks

The `notebooks` folder contains Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training. These notebooks provide a comprehensive overview of the entire ML pipeline, from data analysis and transformation to model development and evaluation. Each notebook includes detailed explanations, code snippets, and visualizations.

## Models

The `models` folder is located in the root directory and contains the exported ML models. Each model is saved in the TensorFlow SavedModel format, which allows for easy loading and deployment. The trained models are ready to be used for inference or further fine-tuning.

Feel free to explore the code and notebooks provided to gain a deeper understanding of the ML models and their implementation.

## Additional Resources

For more information and detailed explanations, please refer to the project's documentation and the individual notebooks within the `notebooks` folder.

If you have any questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to contact our support team.

We hope you find the ML documentation helpful in understanding the models and their training pipeline!
